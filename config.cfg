# are specified in the [channels] section.

# A module that provides commands for basic administrative
# functions like joining/parting channels and reloading
# modules. In order to use these commands a user must have
# a hostmask listed in the [admins] section (or the is_admin
# function in the module must be changed to some other form
# of authentication).

[channels]
# A list of channels to automatically join when connected to the
# IRC server. Channels that don't have a prefix character already
# will have a '#' added. Channels that begin with an apostrophe
# will have the apostrophe stripped (useful for things like ##foo).
# If a value is specified for an item, it will be used as the IRC
# channel join key.

# Join a channel "#whiskeyroom" with no key
whiskeyroom

[admins]
# A list of users that should be allowed to execute admin-only
# commands via the kitnirc.contrib.admintools module. Only
# nickname and host are checked by default - any specified
# username will be ignored. If you want to use a different method
# of authenticating administrators, assign a new function to the
# 'is_admin' variable in the kitnirc.contrib.admintools module.

# Replace this with your own nickname@hostname value.
